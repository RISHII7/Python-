# Python: Comments, Escape Sequences & Print Statement

## 1. Comments in Python

Comments are used to explain code and make it more readable. They are ignored by the Python interpreter and do not affect the execution of the program. There are two types of comments in Python:

### 1.1. Single-line Comments
A single-line comment starts with the `#` symbol. Everything after the `#` on that line is treated as a comment.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This is an inline comment
```

### 1.2. Multi-line Comments
A multi-line comment can be written using triple quotes ''' or """. These comments span across multiple lines.

```python
'''
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
'''
print("This is a Python program.")

# Alternatively, you can use triple double quotes
"""
This is another example of a multi-line comment.
It also spans multiple lines.
"""
```

## 2. Escape Sequences in Python
Escape sequences are special characters used in strings to represent certain whitespace characters or symbols that cannot be typed directly.

### 2.1. Common Escape Sequences

| Escape Sequence | Description                           | Example                      |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `\n`            | Newline (line break)                  | `print("Hello\nWorld!")`      |
| `\t`            | Tab                                   | `print("Hello\tWorld!")`      |
| `\\`            | Backslash                             | `print("C:\\Program Files")`  |
| `\'`            | Single quote                          | `print('It\'s Python!')`      |
| `\"`            | Double quote                          | `print("He said, \"Hello!\"")`|
| `\r`            | Carriage return                       | `print("Hello\rWorld")`       |
| `\b`            | Backspace                             | `print("Hello\bWorld!")`      |
| `\f`            | Formfeed (new page)                   | `print("Hello\fWorld!")`      |
| `\u`            | Unicode character (4-digit)           | `print("\u0048ello")` (Outputs: "Hello") |


### 2.2. Example Usage of Escape Sequences
```python
# Example of newline and tab escape sequences
print("Hello\nWorld!")    # Prints "Hello" and "World!" on separate lines
print("Hello\tWorld!")    # Prints "Hello" and "World!" separated by a tab

# Example of backslash and quote escape sequences
print("C:\\Users\\Admin")  # Prints file path with backslashes
print('It\'s Python!')     # Prints: It's Python!
print("He said, \"Hello!\"")  # Prints: He said, "Hello!"
```

## 3. The Print Statement in Python
The `print()` function in Python is used to display output to the console.

### 3.1. Basic Print Statement
The most basic form of the print statement is to print a string or variable:
```python
print("Hello, World!")  # Prints: Hello, World!
```

### 3.2. Printing Multiple Items
You can print multiple items by separating them with commas. Python automatically inserts spaces between items:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(name, age)  # Prints: Alice 30
```

### 3.3. Customizing the Print Statement
You can customize the print statement using optional arguments:

- `sep`: Specifies the separator between items (default is a space).
- `end`: Specifies the character to append at the end of the output (default is a newline).

### 3.3.1. Example of `sep` Argument
```python
print("apple", "banana", "cherry", sep=", ")  # Prints: apple, banana, cherry
```

### 3.3.2. Example of `end` Argument
```python
print("Hello", end=" ")  # Ends with a space instead of a newline
print("World!")          # Prints on the same line: Hello World!
```

### 3.4. Printing Special Characters
To print special characters, like backslashes or quotes, you need to escape them using the backslash `\`:
```python
print("C:\\Users\\Admin")  # Prints: C:\Users\Admin
print("He said, \"Hello!\"")  # Prints: He said, "Hello!"
```
